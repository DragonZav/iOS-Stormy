# iOS-Stormy
A Teamtreehouse weather app project using JSON and the forecast.io api 

This app will not function without an API key from forecast.io. I removed the key because I only get 1000 free requests per day. Anyone interested in using this application must sign up with www.forecast.io and acquire thier own API key. Then just paste the key into the forecastAPIKey variable within the WeeklyTableViewController.swift file.
